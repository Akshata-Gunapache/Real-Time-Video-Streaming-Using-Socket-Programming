# Real-Time-Video-Streaming-Using-Socket-Programming

Real-time video streaming is a critical technology in today's digital age. It enables people to communicate with each other through video in real-time, regardless of their physical location. Socket programming in Python is a powerful tool for developing real-time video streaming applications. 

In this project, we will use socket programming in Python to create a real-time video streaming application.The application we will develop will allow users to stream live video from their cameras to a central server, which can then be accessed by other users in real-time. The primary focus of this project will be on the technical aspects of creating the application, including the use of Python's socket programming library, and the implementation of the application's various components.Sockets are endpoints that allow communication between two computers over a network. <br>

Python's socket library provides a simple interface for creating sockets and sending and receiving data over a network.And we will do the implementation of the real-time video streaming application using socket programming in Python. The application will consist of two main components: the client and the server. The client will be responsible for capturing video from the user's camera and sending it to the server in real-time. The server, on the other hand, will be responsible for receiving the video streams from multiple clients and distributing them to other clients in real-time.We will delve into the specifics of how to capture video from the camera using Python's OpenCV library, and how to send the video data over a socket connection to the server. We will also cover how to receive and display the video data on the client side, using Python's socket and OpenCV libraries.

The project is based on a client-server model where the client captures and encodes the video stream, and the server broadcasts it back to the client. The implementation involves the use of various libraries and tools, such as Socket Programming in Python for establishing the network communication.Finally, we will conclude of the potential applications of real-time video streaming using socket programming in Python. Real-time video streaming is a critical technology for many applications, including video conferencing, surveillance systems, and online gaming.
